    <description lang="en">Peaky Blinders is a British television crime drama set in 1920s Birmingham, England in the aftermath of World War I. The series, which was created by Steven Knight and produced by Caryn Mandabach Productions, Screen Yorkshire and Tiger Aspect Productions, follows the exploits of the Shelby crime family. It was the first production to benefit from investment through Screen Yorkshire's Yorkshire Content Fund, ensuring the bulk of the production was filmed in Yorkshire.[1] Cillian Murphy plays Tommy Shelby, the gang's leader, and Sam Neill as Chester Campbell is a commissioned detective who is tasked with suppressing the gang.[2] The series creators have reused the name of Peaky Blinders, a 19th century urban youth gang who were active in the city until the 1890s and were believed to sew razor blades into their caps.
